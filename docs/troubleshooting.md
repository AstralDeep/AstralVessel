# Troubleshooting

## The node image is not on this machine

`up` stops with the image name. Build or pull a node image with the kernel binding and tag it with that name, or set `image` in `[node]`.

## The node never becomes ready

Run `docker compose -f compose.generated.yml logs node`. The node exits with code 78 when a secret, the issuer or the data directory is missing or unwritable. Production is the default, so an `http` issuer needs `ASTRAL_ENV = "development"` under `[node.environment]`. Use that only for development.

## A sandbox exits at start

```text
this kernel lacks Landlock ABI 6
```

The host kernel is too old. See [Platform support](security/platforms.md).

## The probes fail

`check` prints the failing check by container. A failure in a sandbox probe means isolation does not hold on this host. Do not use the deployment until it passes.

## `pair` says the node refused the owner token

The token must be current, from the issuer in `[owner]`, for the one owner the node serves. A token for another owner gets HTTP 403.

## `pair --executor` says the node has not joined

The executor waits for the node's mailbox, which exists only after the node has joined the owner's mesh. Pair the node first.

## Every call is refused with `executor.no_kernel`

The kernel binding does not import in the executor's image. An image built here always has it, because the build fails without the pinned wheel. Rebuild from this checkout with `[executor] kernel_artifacts` set, or use the released image.

## The image build says it needs the pinned kernel wheel

The build checks the wheel's sha256 against `config/kernel-binding.json` and stops if the wheel is missing or differs. Point `[executor] kernel_artifacts` at the folder that holds `astral_kernel-<version>-py3-none-manylinux_2_36_<arch>.whl`. The binding pins only the architectures it lists.

## A call is refused with a `ticket.*` code

The ticket did not verify. The code says why, for example `ticket.expired`, `ticket.mesh_mismatch` or `gate.mesh_stopped`. The executor runs nothing in that case.
